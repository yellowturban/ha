1.  https://htmlpreview.github.io/
2. Use Github Pages 
Navigate to https://yellowturban.github.io/ha/
To access individual files, replace {...}, https://yellowturban.github.io/ha/Discord/{name}/{date formatted as yyyy-mm-dd}/{channel name with other numbers}
For {channel name with other numbers}, individually access it through this repository.

## Compare files
You can load diff between dates, and commits (of same files across times).

## Dealing with Name Change
The most robust method is to identify an account with discord user id available on this repository with the HTML tag. Name can be changed (Username, the plaintext username you see on screenshots/images and Discord name can be easily changed for free as Discord offers)

## Periodic changes
Upload only periodic changes, not realtime changes (I haven't and not able to do that yet unless someone has developed a software for this).

## What you can do to contribute
1. Help to archive photos, media, and username (with 4 digit number tag after "#") and update this repository

## Privacy Concerns
Users should not be met with privacy concerns, we only export things that can also be seen by the public, anonymously. Users who post expect that anyone with the public link can join and read what they send.
